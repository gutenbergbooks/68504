<h3>
JOHN HENRY AT THE RACES.
</h3>

<p>
I was anxious to make Clara Jane
think that she was all the money,
so I boiled out a few plunks,
trotted over to the trolley, and rushed
her to the race track.
</p>

<p>
I'm a dub on the dope, but it was
my play to be a Wise Boy among the
skates on this particular occasion, and
I went the whole distance.
</p>

<p>
In the presence of my lady love I
knew every horse that ever pulled a
harrow.
</p>

<p>
Isn't it cruel how a slob will cut the
guy-ropes and go up in the air just
because his Baby is by his side?
</p>

<p>
Me&mdash;to the mountain tops!
</p>

<p>
Before the car got started I was
telling her how Pittsburg Phil and I win
$18,000 last summer on a fried fish
they called "Benzine."
</p>

<p>
Then I confided to her the fact that
I doped a turtle named "Pink Toes"
to win the next day, but he went over
the fence after a loose bunch of grass
and I lose $23,680.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to know what I meant
by dope, and I told her it generally
meant a sour dream, but she didn't
seem to grab.
</p>

<p>
When we got to the track they were
bunching the bones for the first race,
so I told Clara Jane I thought I'd
crawl down to the ring and plaster two
or three thousand around among the
needy.
</p>

<p>
Two or three thousand, and me with
nothing but a five-spot in my jeans and
the return ticket money in that!
</p>

<p>
"Are you really going to bet?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure!" I said; "I've got a pipe!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope you won't smoke it
near me.  I hate pipes!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"All right; I'll take my pipe down
to the betting ring and smoke it
there!" I said, and we parted good
friends.
</p>

<p>
In front of the grand stand I met
Nash Martinetti.
</p>

<p>
He was holding a bunch of poppies
and he picked out one in the first race
and handed it to me.
</p>

<p>
"A skinch!" said Nash.  "Go as
far as you like."
</p>

<p>
Then Ned Rose went into a cataleptic
state and handed me the
winner&mdash;by a block.  It couldn't go wrong
unless its feet fell out.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are, John Henry, the real
Pietro!" said Ban Roberts; "play
Pump Handle straight and place!  It's
the road to wealth&mdash;believe me!  All
the others are behind the hill!"
</p>

<p>
Every Breezy Boy I met had a
different hunch and they called me into
the wharf and unloaded.
</p>

<p>
I figured it out that if I had bet
$5 on each good thing they gave me
I would have lost $400,000.
</p>

<p>
Then I ducked under, sopped up a
stein of root beer and climbed up
again to the hurricane deck.
</p>

<p>
"Did you bet?" inquired Clara Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Only $730," I said; "A mere bag
o' shells."
</p>

<p>
I leave a call for 7.30 every morning
and I suppose that's the reason I
was so swift with the figures.
</p>

<p>
"My! what a lot of money!" said
the Fair One; "do point out the horse
you bet on!  I shall be awfully
interested in this race!"
</p>

<p>
Carlo! you're a bad dog&mdash;lie down!
</p>

<p>
I pointed out the favorite as the one
I had my bundle on, and explained to
Clara Jane that the only way it could
lose was for some sore-head to get
out and turn the track around.
</p>

<p>
Sure enough the favorite galloped
into port and dropped anchor six hours
ahead of the other clams.
</p>

<p>
I win over $2,200&mdash;conversation
money&mdash;and Bonnie Brighteyes was in
a frenzy of delight.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to know if I wasn't going
to be awfully careful with it and
save it up for a rainy day.
</p>

<p>
I told her yes, but I expected we'd
have a storm that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
I had a nervous chill for fear she'd
declare herself in on the rake-off.
</p>

<p>
But she didn't, so I excused myself
and backed down the ladder to cash
in.
</p>

<p>
The boys were all out in the inquest
room trying to find out what killed
the dead ones.
</p>

<p>
Then they stopped apologizing to
themselves and began to pick things
out of the next race and push them
up their sleeves.
</p>

<p>
I ran across Harry Maddy and he
took me up to the roof with a line of
talk about a horse called "Pretty Boy"
in the last race.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p19"></a>
"He'll be over 80 to 1 and it's a
killing," Harry insisted.  "Get down
to the bank when the doors open and
grab all you can.  Take a satchel and
the ice-tongs and haul it away."
</p>

<p>
I was beginning to be impressed.
</p>

<p>
"Put a fiver on Pretty Boy," Harry
continued, "and you'll find yourself
dropping over in the Pierp Morgan
class before sun down."
</p>

<p>
"This may be a real Alexander," I
said to myself.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty Boy can stop in the stretch
to do a song and dance and still win by
a bunch of houses," Harry informed me.
</p>

<p>
I began to think hard.
</p>

<p>
"Don't miss it," said Harry.  "It's
a moral that if you play him you'll
die rich and disgraced, like our friend
Andy, the Hoot Mon!"
</p>

<p>
When I got back to the stand I had
a preoccupied air.
</p>

<p>
The five-spot in my jeans was crawling
around and begging for a change
of scene.
</p>

<p>
When Clara Jane asked me how
much I had bet on the race just about
to start I could only think of $900.
</p>

<p>
When she wanted to know which
horse I pointed my finger at every toad
on the track and said "that one over
there!"
</p>

<p>
It won.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the third race I was
$19,218 to the good.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane had it down in black and
white on the back of an envelope in
figures that couldn't lie.
</p>

<p>
She said she was very proud of me,
and that's where my finish bowed
politely and stood waiting.
</p>

<p>
She told me that it was really very
wrong to bet any more after such a
run of luck, and made me promise
that I wouldn't wring another dollar
from the trembling hands of the poor
Bookmakers.
</p>

<p>
I promised, but she didn't notice
that I had my fingers crossed.
</p>

<p>
I simply <i>had</i> to have a roll to flash
on the way home, so I took my lonely
V and went out into the Promised
Land after the nuggets Maddy had put
me wise to.
</p>

<p>
"It will be just like getting money
from Uncle Peter," I figured.
</p>

<p>
"A small steak from Pretty Boy,"
I said to Wise Samuel, the
Bookmaker; "what's doing?"
</p>

<p>
Wise Samuel gave me the gay look-over.
</p>

<p>
"Take the ferry for Sioux Falls!"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Nix on the smart talk, Sammy!"
I said; "Me for the Pretty Boy!  How
much?"
</p>

<p>
"A bundle for a bite&mdash;you're on a
cold plate!" whispered Wise Samuel,
but he couldn't throw me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any derricks to hoist
the price with," I tapped him.
</p>

<p>
"Write your own ticket, then you
to the woods!" said Sammy.
</p>

<p>
In a minute my fiver was up and I
was on the card to win $500 when my
cute one came romping home.
</p>

<p>
I went back to Clara Jane satisfied
that in a few minutes I'd have a roll
big enough to choke the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
"Not having any money on this
race you can watch it without the least
excitement, can't you?" she said.
</p>

<p>
I said yes, and all the while I was
scrapping with a lump in my throat
the size of my fist.
</p>

<p>
When the horses got away with
Pretty Boy in front I started in to
stand on my head, but changed my
mind and swallowed half the program.
</p>

<p>
Pretty Boy at the quarter! Me for
Rector's till they put the shutters up!
</p>

<p>
Pretty Boy at the half!   Me down
to Tiffany's in the morning dragging
tiaras away in a dray!
</p>

<p>
Pretty Boy at the three-quarter pole!
Me doing the free library gag all over
the place!
</p>

<p>
But just as they came in the stretch
Pretty Boy forgot something and went
back after it.
</p>

<p>
The roach quit me cold at the very
door of the safety deposit vaults.
</p>

<p>
I was under the water a long time.
</p>

<p>
Finally I heard Clara Jane saying,
"Isn't it lucky you didn't bet on this
race.  I believe you would have picked
that foolish looking horse that stopped
over there to bite the fence!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm done! turn me over!" I
murmured, and then I rushed down among
the ramblers and made a swift touch
for the price of a couple of rides home.
</p>

<p>
On the way back Clara Jane made
me promise again that I'd be awfully,
awfully careful of my $19,218.
</p>

<p>
I promised her I would.

<h3>
JOHN HENRY WITH THE DRUMMERS.
</h3>

<p>
It was a swift squad of sports that
climbed into a coach and
allowed themselves to be yanked
over the rails in the direction of
Chicago one morning last week.
</p>

<p>
A bunch of brisk boys&mdash;believe me!
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-029"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-029.jpg" alt="&quot;A bunch of brisk boys--believe me!&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;A bunch of brisk boys&mdash;believe me!&quot;
</p>

<p>
Nick Dalrymple, Tod Stone, Slim
Barnes&mdash;say! do you remember Slim?
</p>

<p>
Travels for a clothing house in
Cincinnati and they call him Slim because
he's so fat that every time he turns
around he meets himself coming back.
</p>

<p>
He's all to the good&mdash;that boy is!
</p>

<p>
And such a cut-up!
</p>

<p>
Slim knows more
"look-out!&mdash;there's - a - lady - over - there!" stories
than any other drummer in the business.
</p>

<p>
Nick goes after the gilt things for a
hardware house in Columbus and he
knows everybody in the world&mdash;bar no
one living.
</p>

<p>
Nick has only one trouble, he will
paddle after the ponies.
</p>

<p>
Whenever he makes a town where
there's a pool room his expense
account gets fat and beefy, and Nick
begins to worry for fear he may win
something.
</p>

<p>
He won $12 in Cleveland once and
he spent $218 at a boozeologist's that
night getting statistics on how it happened.
</p>

<p>
Tod Stone cuts ice for a match
factory in Newark and he's the life of
a small party.
</p>

<p>
Tod's main hold is to creep into the
"reading room" of a Rube hotel after
the chores are done of an evening and
throw salve at the come-ons.
</p>

<p>
Tod tells them that their town is
the brightest spot on the map and they
warm up to him and want to buy him
sarsaparilla and root beer.
</p>

<p>
Then when he gets them stuck on
themselves he sells them matches.
</p>

<p>
"Pipe the gang to quarters and all
rubber!" said Slim, about half an hour
after the train pulled out.
</p>

<p>
In the seat ahead of us a somewhat
demure looking Proposition in
rainbow rags had been sampling the
scenery ever since we started.
</p>

<p>
We had all given her the glad glance
but she was very much Cold Storage,
so we passed it up.
</p>

<p>
As Slim spoke, the Proposition was
joined by a young chap with a loose
face who had been out in the smoking
room working faithfully on one of
those pajama panatella cigars that bite
you on the ringer if you show the least
sign of fear.
</p>

<p>
Just then the train stopped for a few
minutes and we were put wise to the
fact that it was an incurable case of
bride and groom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Boozey is back to his
Birdie!" said the brand new wife;
"did Boozey like his smoky woky?"
</p>

<p>
Boozey opened a bunch of grins and
sat down while wifey patted his cheek
and cooed:
</p>

<p>
"Is ums glad to get back to ums
'ittle wifey-pifey?"
</p>

<p>
Nick Dalrymple and Tod Stone
began to scream inwardly and Slim was
chuckling like a pet porpoise.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetie mustn't be angry with
Petie, but Sweetie is sitting on Petie's
'ittle hand!" said the bride, whereupon
Tod exploded and Slim began to
grab for his breath.
</p>

<p>
A Dutch brewer and his wife sat
right ahead of Boozey and Birdie and
every once in a while the old hop
puncher would turn around and beam
benignly over the gold rims at the
bride.
</p>

<p>
"Boozie must snuggy-wuggy up
closer to his Coozie and skeeze her
'itty arm&mdash;no, no, not her waist! you
naughty! naughty!"
</p>

<p>
The brewer was back at the bride
with another gold-rimmed goo-goo
when his wife got nervous and cut in:
</p>

<p>
"Is id you turn your face to see
someding&mdash;yes?" she snapped, and
the foam builder ducked to the window
and began to eat scenery.
</p>

<p>
Dalrymple was almost out; Tod was
under the seat sparring for wind; Slim
was giving an imitation of a coal-barge
in a heavy sea, and the rest of
the passengers were in various stages
from hiccoughs to convulsions.
</p>

<p>
"Is Boozey comfy wif his 'itty
weeny teeny Birdie?" chirped the
bride.
</p>

<p>
"Boozey is so happy wif his izzy-wizzy!"
gurgled the husband; "how's
my 'ittle girley wirly?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! she's such a happy wappy
'ittle fing!" giggled the dotty dame,
pinching her piggie's ear, whereupon
the brewer tried to hand the bride
another gasoline gaze, but the old lady
caught him with the goods:
</p>

<p>
"Is id to my face you go behind my
back to make googley-googley eyes
ad somevun&mdash;yes?" she growled, and
in a minute the brewer's brow was
busy with the window pane.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetie looks at Petie and Sweetie
sees that Petie's p'etty face is getting
sunburned, so it is!" cuckooed
Mrs. Daffy; "and Sweetie has a dood mind
to tiss him, too!"
</p>

<p>
They opened a newspaper, crawled
under cover and began to bite each
other on the chin.
</p>

<p>
"Go as far as you like!" said Slim,
then he went down and out.
</p>

<p>
The man who helped to make
Weehawken famous had his head out
the window watching for an ice-wagon,
and Mrs. Brewer was industriously
muttering "Du bist ein Narr.
Du bist ein Narr!"
</p>

<p>
Just then the train pulled out and
saved our lives.
</p>

<p>
Nick, Tod, Slim and I went over
near the water-cooler to rest up, and
in a minute the three of them were
fanning each other with fairy tales
about the goods they sold.
</p>

<p>
I'll back these three boys to dream
longer than any other drummers on
the track.
</p>

<p>
It's a pipe that they can sell bills to
each other all day and never wake up.
</p>

<p>
Slim turned the gas on to the limit
about hypnotizing a John Wanamaker
merchant prince in Pikesville,
Indiana, to the extent of $200 for
open-work socks, farmer's size, and Todd
Stone sent his balloon up by telling us
how he sold the Siegel-Coopers of
Bugsport, Iowa, $300 worth of
Panama hats for horses.
</p>

<p>
The Hot Air Association was in full
session when Buck Jones caromed
over from the other end of the car and
weighed-in with us.
</p>

<p>
Buck is a sweller.
</p>

<p>
He thinks he strikes twelve on all
occasions, but his clock is all to the
bad.
</p>

<p>
Buck isn't a drummer&mdash;nay! nay! take
back your gold!
</p>

<p>
He'll look you straight in the eye
and tell you he's a <i>travelling
salesman</i>&mdash;nix on the drummer!
</p>

<p>
I think Buck sells canned shirt
waists for the Shine Brothers.
</p>

<p>
Buck's wife and a three-year-old
were traveling with him, but he wasn't
giving it out through a megaphone.
</p>

<p>
Buck is one of those goose-headed
guys who begin to scratch gravel and
start in to make a killing every time
they see a pretty girl.
</p>

<p>
Across the aisle sat two pet canaries
from Plainfield, New Jersey.
</p>

<p>
They were members of the Soubrette
Stinging Society and they were
en route to the West to join the
"Bunch of Birds Burlesque Company."
</p>

<p>
Their names were Millie and Tillie
and they wore Florodora hats and did
a sister act that contained more bad
grammar than an East Side pinochle
game.
</p>

<p>
Millie was fully aware that she
could back Duse off the map, and
Tillie was ready to bet a week's salary
that she could make Bernhardt feel
like she was out in the storm we had
day before yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Slim called them the Roast-Beef
Sisters, Rare and Well-done.
</p>

<p>
In a minute the castors on Buck's
neck began to turn.
</p>

<p>
Slim put us wise with a wink so
we lit the fire and began to cook it up.
</p>

<p>
Buck's heart was warming for the
birds in the gilded cage.
</p>

<p>
"The real Kibo!" said Slim; "it's
a plain case of Appomattox; the war
is over and they are yours, Buck!"
</p>

<p>
Buck turned a few more volts into
his twinkling lamps.
</p>

<p>
"Lower your mainsail, Buck, and
drop alongside; you've made the
landing," suggested Nick.
</p>

<p>
Buck began to feel his necktie and
play patty-cake with the little bald
spot on the top of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Stop the hansom and get out;
you're at your corner," said Tod.
</p>

<p>
The Sweet Dreams across the way
were giving Buck the glorious eye-roll
and he felt that dinner was ready.
</p>

<p>
"Hang up your hat, Buck, and
gather the myrtle with Mary!" I
chipped in.
</p>

<p>
Then Buck bounced over and began
to show Millie and Tillie what a
handsome brute he was at close quarters.
</p>

<p>
He sat on the arm of the seat and
steamed up.
</p>

<p>
In less than a minute he crowded
the information on them that he was a
millionaire who had escaped from Los
Angeles, Cal., and he was just going
to put them both in grand opera when
his three-year-old toddled down the
aisle and grabbed him by the coat tail:
</p>

<p>
"Papa!  Mama wants 'oo to det my
bottle of milk!"
</p>

<p>
"Stung!" shrieked Slim.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the nursery!" howled
Tod, and then as Buck crawled away
to home and mother we let out a yell
that caused the conductor to think the
train had struck a Wild West show.
</p>

<p>
During the rest of the trip Buck
was nailed to his seat.
</p>

<p>
Every time he tried to use the elastic
in his neck the wife would burn him
with a hard, cold glitter.
</p>

<p>
The Roast-Beef Sisters seemed to be
all carved up about something or
other.
</p>

<p>
We were back to the shop selling
things again when Sledgeheimer
fluttered down among us.
</p>

<p>
The boys call him putty because he's
the next thing to a pane.
</p>

<p>
He's such a stingy loosener that he
looks at you with one eye so's not to
waste the other.
</p>

<p>
If you ask Sledgeheimer what time
it is he takes off four minutes as his
commission for telling you.
</p>

<p>
"Barnes," said Sledgeheimer, "do
you smoke?"
</p>

<p>
It was a knock-out.
</p>

<p>
In the annals of the road no one
could look back to the proud day when
Sledgeheimer had coughed.
</p>

<p>
Once, so the legend runs, he gave
a porter a nickel, but it was
afterwards discovered that Sledgeheimer
was asleep and not responsible at the
time, so the porter gave it back.
</p>

<p>
Sledgeheimer tried to collect three
cents interest for the time the porter
kept the nickel, and the conductor had
to punch his mileage and his nose
before he'd let go.
</p>

<p>
And now Sledgeheimer had asked
Barnes if he smoked.
</p>

<p>
Slim was pale but game.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes!" he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you like a goot seegar?"
queried Sledgeheimer.
</p>

<p>
We looked for the engine to hit a
cow any minute now.
</p>

<p>
"Sure!" said Slim, weak all over.
</p>

<p>
"Vell," said Sledgeheimer, "here
is my brudder-in-law's card.  He
makes dot Grass Vidow seegar on
Sigsth Afenue.  Gif him a call und
mention my name.  He vill be glat to
see you, yet."
</p>

<p>
Then Sledgeheimer went away back
and sat down.
</p>

<p>
The laugh was on Slim so he got
busy with the button.
</p>

<h3>
JOHN HENRY IN BOHEMIA.
</h3>

<p>
Boys! let me put you wise!  If
you want to keep off the
griddle don't ever try to
show your shy little lady friend how
the birdies sing in "Bohemia."
</p>

<p>
You'll get stung if you do.
</p>

<p>
For the past six months Clara Jane
has been handing out hints that she'd
like to have me take her down the line
and let her Oh, listen to the band! in
one of those real devilish New York
restaurants.
</p>

<p>
She intimated that she'd like to sit
in the grand stand and hold the watch
on those who are going the pace that
kills.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to know if I thought
she could toy with a tenderloin steak
in a careless café without getting the
call down from Uncle William.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane's Uncle William hands
out the lesson leaflets in Sunday
school and wrestles the Golden Rule
to a finish every Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
During the week he conducts a fire
sale.
</p>

<p>
I told her I thought she could and
she was pleased.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just crazy to take lunch,
sometime, among the Bohemians!" she
gurgled.
</p>

<p>
I told her I though she'd have a
happier time if we tramped down to
the tunnel and butted in among the
Italians just as the twelve o'clock
whistle blew, and she threw both
lamps at me good and hard.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane spent the summer once
at Sag Harbor and she's been a
subscriber for <i>The Young Ladies' Home
Companion</i>, but outside of these her
young life has been devoid of excitement.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago I took her to the
matinee at "The New York" where
you have to pinch off only 50 cents and
then you're entitled to slosh around in
parlor furniture and eat up about $8
worth of comedy.
</p>

<p>
That "New York" thing is immense&mdash;believe me!
</p>

<p>
Everything else has faded away.
</p>

<p>
After the show we thought we'd pat
the pave for a few blocks and who
should we run into but Bud Phillips.
</p>

<p>
Bud belongs to the Grand Lodge of
Good Fellows.
</p>

<p>
So far as I can size him up the
Good Fellow puts in twelve hours a
day trying to stab himself to death
with gin rickeys, and the other twelve
are devoted to yelling for help and ice-water.
</p>

<p>
This is not a tap on the door.  Nix
on the knock.
</p>

<p>
It isn't my cue to aim the hammer.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to falling off the
water wagon I can do a bit of a
specialty in grand and lofty tumbling
that gets a loud hand from all the
members of the High Tide Association.
So nix on the knock.
</p>

<p>
His father cut out the breathing
business about two years ago and left
Bud $100,000 and a long dry spell on
the inside.
</p>

<p>
Bud has been in the lake ever since.
</p>

<p>
"As you were!" said Bud.  "Why,
it's John Henry! touch thumbs, old
pal?" and then in a side speech he
wanted to know what troupe the
soubrette was cutting-up with.
</p>

<p>
If Clara Jane had heard him my
finish would have hopped over the
fence then and there.
</p>

<p>
But she didn't, so I introduced them
and quietly tipped Bud off to the fact
that it will be a case of wedding bells
when Willie gets a wad&mdash;be nice! be
nice!
</p>

<p>
And Bud woke up to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"You to the carryall!" he said.
"I'll float you down to Muttheimer's
and we'll get busy with the beans!"
</p>

<p>
"He's out to cough for a few cookies,"
I explained to Clara Jane.
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of Muttheimer's
before," said Clara Jane, on the side.
</p>

<p>
"You luck has given you a thrown-down,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"But I do hope it's Bohemian," she
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Sure!" I said.  I hated to break
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Muttheimer's is one of those eateries
where the waiters look wise because
they can't speak English.
</p>

<p>
If you ask them a question they bark
at you in German.
</p>

<p>
It's supposed to be Bohemian because
there's sawdust on the floor and
the flies wear pajamas and say
"Prosit!" before falling in the stuff that
you swallow to-day and taste to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
Bud bunches his hits on the bell and
the low-forehead has a Fitzsimmons
hug on the order when Ikey Mincenpizenstein
crawls into the harbor and
drops anchor at our table.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how Ikey ever
pressed close enough to get on Bud's
staff.
</p>

<p>
Ikey is a lazy loosener.
</p>

<p>
When the waiter deals out the check
Ikey is the busiest talker in the bunch.
</p>

<p>
Whenever he passes a bank he takes
off his hat and walks on his toes.
</p>

<p>
He's the sort of a Sim Dempsey
who sheds in-growing tears every
time anybody spends money in his
neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
He hates to see it wasted, and that's
why his whiskers peep out of his face
and worry the wind.
</p>

<p>
But, then, a Good Fellow doesn't
have to go to sea to gather barnacles.
</p>

<p>
I spoke his name fast when I introduced
Ikey to Clara Jane but she was
busy trying to live a swift life by
ordering a seltzer lemonade, so it didn't
make much difference, anyway.
</p>

<p>
"What is he?" she whispered after
a bit, "a painter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! he's a painter all right," I
said.  "When some one leads him up
to a tub."
</p>

<p>
"Water-colors or oil?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oil," I said; "Fusel oil."
</p>

<p>
"Has he ever done any good
thing?" said she.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "Bud Phillips."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm enjoying this so much!
Who is the man with the fawn-like
eyes and the long hair at that other
table?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
He was the night-watchman of the
apartment house next door but I gave
her an easy speech to the effect that
he was Bill Beethoven, a grandson of
old man Beethoven who wrote the
wedding march and "Mah Rainbow
Coon" and "Father Was a Gentleman
When Mother Was Not Near" and
several other gems.
</p>

<p>
She thought she was in Bohemia
and having the time of her life, so I
let her dream.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Bud was busy trying
to put out the fire in the well
Ikey used for a neck.
</p>

<p>
Every time a waiter looked over at
out table Bud's roll would blaze up.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane concluded she'd broaden
out a bit on Art and the Old Masters
so she asked Ikey if he liked
Rembrandt.
</p>

<p>
Ikey looked at her out of the
corner of one eye and said, "Much
'bliged, but I'm up to here now!"
</p>

<p>
Then he went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Bud was beginning to see double.
Every once in a while he'd stop trying
to whistle "Sallie, My Hot Tamale,"
and he'd look over at Clara Jane and
hand her a sad, sad smile.
</p>

<p>
Then he'd press money in the waiter's
hand and wait for his music cue.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane had about decided that
Bohemia was away up stage, but I
wouldn't let go.  I wanted her to
get the lesson of her life, and that's
where my finish began to get busy.
</p>

<p>
Tom Barclay waltzed into the subway,
saw me and in a minute he was
making the break of his life.
</p>

<p>
"Why, hello, John Henry!" said
Tom, "say, I saw her to-day&mdash;and
she's immense!  You've got a great
eye, old man!"
</p>

<p>
I tossed off a few wicked winks on
that great eye of mine but Tom went
right along to the funeral.
</p>

<p>
"Lizzie B. is a peach, John Henry!
You've got the eye for the good girls,
all right, all right!" he chortled.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane began to freeze.
</p>

<p>
I felt like a boiled potato in the
hands of an Irish policeman.
</p>

<p>
"She's every bit to the good, old
man!" Tom turned it on again; "she
makes all the other birds chatter in the
cage.  And her feet&mdash;did you ever see
such feet?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at Clara Jane's face, but
there was no light in the window for me.
</p>

<p>
"You certainly picked out a warm
proposition when you put your arms
around Lizzie B. and I'm your friend
for life for hauling me up in the
chariot with you&mdash;what'll you have?"
croaked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-two bars rest," I whispered
hoarsely; "cut it all out!"
</p>

<p>
"Cut out nothing!" said the prize
idiot; "We'll drink to Lizzie B.
What'll your lady friend have?"
</p>

<p>
When Clara Jane arose she was a
mass of icicles.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John Henry! will you have
the kindness to escort me to a car?"
she said, giving me the glittering
gig-lamps, "then you may return and
discuss your affairs of the heart at your
leisure."
</p>

<p>
"Stung!" said Bud, bringing his
hand down on the table so vigorously
that Ikey woke up and ordered
another high-ball.
</p>

<p>
Me&mdash;to the Badlands!  It took me
three mortal hours to convince her that
Tom <i>was only talking about a horse</i>.
</p>

<p>
Hereafter when Clara Jane yearns
for something swift I'll take her down
and let her watch the trolley cars go by.
</p>

<h3>
JOHN HENRY AND THE HOTEL CLERK.
</h3>

<p>
Kee Barclay, Jim Wilkinson
and I were leaning over
the counter talking to His
Nobs, the Hotel Clerk, when Dan the
Dyspeptic squeezed up and began to
let a peep out of him about the pie he
had eaten for dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Calm yourself!" said Smiling
Steve, "and tell me where it bit you."
</p>

<p>
Steve has been throwing keys at
the wall for some time, and he knows
how to burn the beefers.
</p>

<p>
"Bit me! bit me!" snarled the old
chap; "nothing of the kind, sir!  I
want you to know, sir, that your pie
isn't fit to eat, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Cut it out!" suggested Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Cut it out, sir! how can I cut it
out when I've eaten it, sir?  It's an
outrage and I shall leave this hotel
to-morrow," said Dan.
</p>

<p>
"With the exception of $31.72, balance
due, that will be about all from
you!" said Steve.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see the proprietor," said the
old fellow, moving away with a face
on him like an interrupted beef stew.
</p>

<p>
"We get it good and plenty every
day," said Steve, and just then Skate
Peters grabbed the book and burned
his John Hancock on it.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-064"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-064.jpg" alt="&quot;'We get it good and plenty every day!' said Steve.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;'We get it good and plenty every day!' said Steve.&quot;
</p>

<p>
I knew his name was Skate because
it looked like one on the register.
</p>

<p>
"Bath?" queried Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Only during a hot wave," said
Skate.
</p>

<p>
Steve went to the ropes, but he came
up smiling, as usual.
</p>

<p>
"American or European?" asked Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Neither," said Skate; "Don't you
see I'm from Jersey City."
</p>

<p>
"Going to be with us long?"
inquired Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Bub! you're hellanall on
asking questions, now aint you?"
answered Skate; "you just push me into
a stall and lock the gate&mdash;I'm tired."
</p>

<p>
"Front! show this gentleman to
49!" said Skate, side-stepping to avoid
punishment.
</p>

<p>
Then Sweet William, the Boy
Drummer, hopped into the ring for the
next round.
</p>

<p>
Willie peddles pickles for the fun
he gets of it.
</p>

<p>
It is Willie's joy and delight to get
a ginger ale bun on and recite "'Ostler
Joe."
</p>

<p>
When trained down to 95 flat Willie
can get up and beat the clapper off
"Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night."
</p>

<p>
When Willie gets a strangle hold
on "Sheridan's Ride" you can hear
horses galloping outside.
</p>

<p>
It's the rest of the community
getting out of harm's way.
</p>

<p>
"Any mail?" inquired Willie.
</p>

<p>
All the mail that Willie ever gets
is a postal card from the pickle factory
every two weeks asking him if the
people along his route have all lost
their appetites.
</p>

<p>
"No literature for you," Steve answered.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," said Willie, "my lady
friends are very remiss, aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it looks like they were out
to drop you behind the piano," said
Steve.
</p>

<p>
Willie tore off a short rabbit laugh
and then inquired what time the next
train left for New York.
</p>

<p>
The pickle factory expects Willie to
make Pocomoke City, Squashtown
Junction and Nubbinsville before next
Sunday, so he tossed the train gag
out just to show Steve that he knows
there's a place called New York.
</p>

<p>
"At 7.45 over the D. L. &amp; Q," said
Steve.
</p>

<p>
"What's the next?" inquired Willie.
</p>

<p>
"At 8.10 over the H. B. &amp; N.,"
Steve answered.
</p>

<p>
"Which gets there first?" Willie
asked.
</p>

<p>
"The engineer," sighed Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you droll chap!" said the
pickle pusher; "give me some toothpicks."
</p>

<p>
Then Sweet William went over to
the big window, burrowed into a chair,
stuck his feet up on the brass rail, ate
toothpicks and thought he was <i>IT</i>.
</p>

<p>
When I got back to Steve he was
dealing out the cards to a lady from
Reading, Pa., and Kee and Jim had
ducked to the billiard room.
</p>

<p>
Her husband had been up in the air
with a bum automobile and when he
came down he was several sections shy.
</p>

<p>
They found a monkey wrench
imbedded in his left shoulder which he
couldn't remember using when he
tried to fix the machine.
</p>

<p>
She was traveling for his health.
</p>

<p>
"My room is too near the elevator,"
she informed Steve.
</p>

<p>
"I can give you a very nice room
on the third floor&mdash;Front! show the
lady&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Same size room?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam."
</p>

<p>
"Same colored carpet on the floor?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe it has&mdash;Front! show the
lady&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Southern exposure?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madam, it's at the end of the
hall."
</p>

<p>
"I want a room near the elevator,
that's always the way in these hotels!
One can never get just what one
wants!  At the end of the hall,
indeed!"  And with this she gave Steve
the Society sting with both eyes and
flounced out.
</p>

<p>
Steve bit the end off a pen holder
and said the rest internally.
</p>

<p>
Just then a couple of troupers
trailed in.
</p>

<p>
They were with the "Bandit's Bride
Co.," and the way had been long and
weary.
</p>

<p>
"What have you got&mdash;double?"
asked the villain of the piece.
</p>

<p>
"Two dollars and up!" said Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing better?" inquired Low
Comedy&mdash;he was making a crack but
nobody caught him.
</p>

<p>
"Four dollars, with bath," Steve
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Board?" asked the villain.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but the sleeps and a fresh
cake of soap," said Steve.
</p>

<p>
"Ring down!" Low Comedy put
in; "Why, we lived a whole week in
Pittsburg for less than that."
</p>

<p>
"You can turn the same trick here
if you carry your own coke and sleep
in the Park," said Steve.
</p>

<p>
"What's the name of this mint?"
asked the villain.
</p>

<p>
Steve told him.
</p>

<p>
"To the tow-path!" said Barrett
Macready; "we're outside the life
lines.  We thought it was the
Liverwurst Hotel where they throw things
at your appetite for $1 a day, double.
To the left, wheel!  Forward, march!"
and once more the drama was on its
way.
</p>

<p>
As Low Comedy turned proudly on
his heel he threw upon the counter
a printed card.
</p>

<p>
Steve had it framed and glued to the
wall next day.
</p>

<p>
It read as follows.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>
JOHN HENRY AND THE BENZINE BUGGY.
</h3>

<p>
A cross-country dub
named Montrose has been
doing the Shine specialty
around Clara Jane lately.
</p>

<p>
He began to call evenings and
bring a bunch of ready-grown flowers
with him as big as a hay stack.
</p>

<p>
Then he'd spread around the parlor
and tell her how he won the long-distance
running jump in the '01 Yale
class.
</p>

<p>
As you approached him from the
front the first name you saw was
Clarence&mdash;Clarence Edgerton Montrose.
</p>

<p>
Wouldn't that slap you!
</p>

<p>
I don't think Clara Jane considered
him the real kittens, but he could talk
fast and use long words and she found
him pleasant company.
</p>

<p>
She said she loved to sit and shade
her eyes with the $8 fan I gave her
and listen to Clarence Edgerton
Montrose while he discoursed about
Palestine and the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
If he was ever there he went in a
hack.
</p>

<p>
That's the trouble with some of
those college come-outs!  The
Professors beat them over the head with
a geography and then as soon as they
get a crowd around they begin to go
to the places that struck them hardest.
</p>

<p>
As an honest, hard-working man it
was my duty to put the boots to
Edgerton and run him down the lane as
far as the eye could see.
</p>

<p>
So I framed up Clarence's finish
with much attention to detail.
</p>

<p>
I looked over Clara Jane's dates
ahead and found that Clarence had
rented the house for a Wednesday
matinee, so I hired one of those
horseless carriage things and pulled up in
front of the windows just about the
time I thought His Feathers would
be playing the overture.
</p>

<p>
I knew that Clara Jane would cancel
the contract with the mutt that
mixed in just as soon as she saw the
automobile snap.
</p>

<p>
I figured that the picture entitled
"The True Lover's Departure in the
Dream Wagon" would put a crimp in
Clarence about the size of a barn door.
</p>

<p>
It was my third or fourth time
behind the lever of the busy barouche,
but I was wise that you pulled the
plug this way when you wanted it to
go ahead, and you shoved it back when
you wanted it to stop.
</p>

<p>
When it came to benzine buggies
I felt that my education was complete.
</p>

<p>
I was George Gazazza, the real
Rolando, when I pulled up in front of
my lady friend's front gate.
</p>

<p>
My market price was $18,000 a
square inch.
</p>

<p>
In six minutes by the watch Clara
Jane was down and in the kerosene
caravan.
</p>

<p>
Clarence hadn't arrived.
</p>

<p>
Somebody must have put him next,
but I knew where he lived and I
figured it out that after we came back
from Lonely Lane I'd send the landau
around and around the block he
camped in till I made him dizzy.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane was the feature of the game.
</p>

<p>
She was the limit in ladies' dress goods.
</p>

<p>
For a chaser she wore one of those
feather boas that feel cool because
they look so warm.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-081"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-081.jpg" alt="&quot;For a chaser she wore one of those feather boas.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;For a chaser she wore one of those feather boas.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Well, I turned the horseless gag into
the shell road and cut loose.
</p>

<p>
We were doing about 43 miles an
hour and the birdies were singing on
the way.
</p>

<p>
Clarence Edgerton Montrose was
working in Shaft No. 3, back in the
mines&mdash;my lady friend told me so.
</p>

<p>
She was having the time of her life.
</p>

<p>
I was her candy boy for sure.
</p>

<p>
Just then something snapped and
the machine started for Portland,
Maine, on the basis of a mile in eight
seconds.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane grabbed me around the
neck and I grabbed the lever.
</p>

<p>
"The eccentric has buckled the
thingamajig!" I yelled, pushing the
lever over to stop the carryall.
</p>

<p>
The thing gave me the horse laugh,
jumped over a telegraph pole, bit its
way through a barb-wire fence and
then started down the road at the rate
of 2,000,000 miles a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you stop it?" screamed
my lady friend.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be the goat; what's the answer?"
I said, clawing the lever and
ducking the low bridges.
</p>

<p>
We met a man on a bicycle and the
last I saw of him as we whizzed by he
had found a soft spot in a field about
four blocks away and he was going
into it head first.
</p>

<p>
We kept his bicycle and carried it
along on our smoke stack.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't stop the thing to save
my life.
</p>

<p>
Every time I yanked the lever the
snap would let a chortle out of its
puzzle department and fly 400 feet
straight through the air.
</p>

<p>
We were headed for an old ash
heap, and my market price had gone
down to three cents a ton.
</p>

<p>
"Don't jump!" I yelled to my lady
friend, but the wind whisked the first
half of my sentence away.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane gathered her skirts in
a bunch and did a flying leap out of
the crazy cab.
</p>

<p>
She landed right in the middle of
that heap of fresh ashes&mdash;and she
made good.
</p>

<p>
All I could see was a great, gray
cloud as I pushed on to the next stand.
About half a mile further down the
road the machine concluded to turn
into a farm-yard and give the home
folks a treat.
</p>

<p>
It went through a window in the
barn, out through a skylight, did the
hula dance over the lawn, and then fell
in the well and stayed there, panting
as though its little gas-engine heart
would break.
</p>

<p>
When I limped back to Clara Jane
the storm signals were flying.
</p>

<p>
She was away out on the ice.
</p>

<p>
The feather boa looked like the hawser
on a canal boat, and the ashes had
changed the pattern of her dress goods.
</p>

<p>
We were stingy talkers on the road home.
</p>

<p>
It will take me two years to square
myself.
</p>

<p>
Hereafter, me to the trolley!
</p>

<p>
Me to the saucy stage coach when
I'm due to gallop away and away!
</p>

<p>
No more benzine buggies for yours
sincerely!
</p>

<p>
Never again for the bughouse
barouche!  Not me.
</p>

<p>
I have only one consolation: The
chap we pried off the bicycle was
Clarence Edgerton Montrose.
</p>

<p>
It will take him about three years
and two months to find all the spots
that foolish-wagon knocked off him.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, I hope to be Clara
Jane's sugar buyer again.
</p>

<h3>
JOHN HENRY AT THE MUSICALE.
</h3>

<p>
Did you ever get ready and go
to a <i>musicale</i>?
</p>

<p>
Isn't it the velvet goods?
</p>

<p>
They pulled off one at Jack Frothingham's
last Wednesday evening and
I had to walk up and down the aisle
with the rest of the bunch.
</p>

<p>
Mind you, I like Jack, so this is no
secret conclave of the Anvil Association.
</p>

<p>
Only, I wish to put him wise that
when he gives his next <i>musicale</i> my
address is Forest Avenue, in the
woods.
</p>

<p>
When I reached Jack's house the
Burnish Brothers were grabbing
groutchy music out of a guitar that
didn't want to give up, and the mad
revel was on.
</p>

<p>
The Burnish Brothers part their
hair in the middle and always do "The
Washington Post" march on their
mandolins for an encore.
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Sousa ever catches them
there'll be a couple of shine
chord-squeezers away to the bad.
</p>

<p>
When the Burnish Brothers took a
bow and backed off we were all
invited to listen to a soprano solo by
Miss Imogene Lukewarm.
</p>

<p>
Somebody went around and locked
the doors, so I made up my mind to
die game.
</p>

<p>
A foolish friend once told Imogene
she could sing, so she went out and
bought up a bunch of tra-la-la's and
began to beat them around the parlor.
</p>

<p>
When Imogene sings she makes
faces at herself.
</p>

<p>
If she needs a high note she goes
after like she was calling the
dachshund in to dinner.
</p>

<p>
Imogene sang "Sleep, Sweetly
Sleep," and then kept us awake with
her voice.
</p>

<p>
After Imogene crept back to her
cave we had the first treat of the
evening, and the shock was so sudden it
jarred us.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Mil came out and quivered a
violin obligato entitled "The Lost
Sheep in the Mountain," and it was
all there is.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Mil was the only green spot
in the desert.
</p>

<p>
When he gathered the gourd up
under his chin and allowed the bow to
tiptoe over the bridge you could hear
the nightingale calling to its mate.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to get up a petition asking
Uncle Mil to play all the evening and
make us all happy, but Will Bruce
wouldn't let me.
</p>

<p>
Will said he wasn't feeling very well
and he wanted to hear the rest of the
program and feel worse.
</p>

<p>
He got his wish.
</p>

<p>
The next thing we had was Sybil,
the Illusionist.
</p>

<p>
Sybil did a lot of mouldy tricks with
cards and every few minutes she fell
down and sprained her sleight of
hand.
</p>

<p>
Sybil was a polish for sure.
</p>

<p>
Then Swift McGee, the Boy Monologuist,
flung himself in the breach
and told a bunch of Bixbys.
</p>

<p>
It was a cruel occasion.
</p>

<p>
Swift had an idea that when it came
to cracking merry booboos he could
pull Lew Dockstader off the horse and
leave him under the fence.
</p>

<p>
As a monologuist Swift thought he
had George Fuller Golden half way
across the bay, and Fred Niblo was
screaming for help.
</p>

<p>
Swift often told himself that he
could give Marshall P. Wilder six
sure-fires and beat him down to the
wire.
</p>

<p>
Swift is one of those low-foreheads
who "write their own stuff" and say
"I done it!"
</p>

<p>
After Swift had talked the audience
into a chill, he pushed on and left us
with a stone bruise on our memories.
</p>

<p>
Then we had Rufus Nelson, the
parlor prestidigitator.
</p>

<p>
Rufus was a bad boy.
</p>

<p>
He cooked an omelet in a silk hat
and when he gave the hat back to
Ed. Walker the poached eggs fell out and
cuddled up in Ed's hair.
</p>

<p>
Rufus apologized and said he'd do
the trick over again if someone else
would lend him a hat, but there was
nothing doing.
</p>

<p>
When the contralto crawled under
the ropes and began to tell us that the
bells in the village rang ding-ding-dong
I was busy watching a Goo-goo Bird.
</p>

<p>
Did you ever spot one of those
Glance-Givers?
</p>

<p>
This chap's name was Llewellyn
Joyce, and he considered himself a
perfect hellyon.
</p>

<p>
He thought all he had to do was to
roll his lamps at a lassie and she was
off the slate.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn loved to sit around at the
<i>musicale</i> and burn the belle of the
ball, with his goo-goo eyes.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn needed a swift slap&mdash;that's
what he needed.
</p>

<p>
Next we had the Nonpariel Quartette,
and they were the boys that could
eat up the close harmony!
</p>

<p>
They sang "Love, I am Lonely!"
from start to finish without stopping
to call the waiter.
</p>

<p>
Then we had Clarissa Coldslaw in
select recitations.
</p>

<p>
She was all the money.
</p>

<p>
Clarissa grabbed "Hamlet's Soliloquy"
between her pearly teeth and
shook it to death.
</p>

<p>
She got a half-Nelson on Poe's "Raven"
and put it out of the business.
</p>

<p>
Then she gave an imitation of the
balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.
</p>

<p>
If Juliet talked like that dame did,
no wonder she took poison.
</p>

<p>
But when she let down her hair and
started in to give us a mad scene&mdash;me
to the sand dunes!
</p>

<p>
It was a case of flee as a bird with
yours respectfully.
</p>

<p>
Those <i>musicale</i> things would be aces
if the music didn't set them back.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
JOHN HENRY ON GOLF.
</h3>

<p>
Hereafter golf is the
game for Gillis!
</p>

<p>
Me for the niblick and
the brassie&mdash;fine!
</p>

<p>
Billy Baldwin, Harry Ford and
Eddie Bartlett took me out last summer
and put me wise to the whole lay-out.
In less than an hour I could play
the game better than Doolan, and he's
the man that made it.
</p>

<p>
Golf has all the other games slapped
to a sit-down.
</p>

<p>
I know it because I played it once
and Billy told me that as soon as a
few Scotch thistles sprouted on my
shins I'd be the real rinakaboo!
</p>

<p>
Harry told me I could drive good
enough to own a hack, and Eddie
thought I was the likeliest side-stepper
that ever did a grass-chopping specialty.
</p>

<p>
The only drawback they found was
that I didn't hit the ball.
</p>

<p>
It's immense for the chest measurement
to have the bunch hand you out
the salve spiel&mdash;believe me!
</p>

<p>
I took my lady friend out Westchester
way last week and on the road I
was Reckless Robert with the big
talk.
</p>

<p>
It's a habit with me to go up and
butt the ceiling every time my lady
friend is near enough to listen.
</p>

<p>
Most of us young guys are gushers
with the loud language when the Best
and Only is in the building.
</p>

<p>
How we do like to gather the gab
and hand out hints to the heroine that
she's gazing on the greatest ever!
</p>

<p>
When Clara Jane asked me if I
knew the game I told her that I used
to room with the man that built the
first links.
</p>

<p>
When she asked me his name I told
her it was McDougall, because that's
the name of a head-waiter who helps
to spend my money.
</p>

<p>
She asked me if I knew what a
lofter is and I said, "Sure, I eat them
for breakfast every morning!"
</p>

<p>
When we reached Westchester we
met a Society duck named Lionel von
Hamburg.
</p>

<p>
I think his father invented the
Hamburger steak.
</p>

<p>
Lionel was all to the best.
</p>

<p>
He was Finnegan the Fine Boy, for
sure.
</p>

<p>
One of those tart little red coats
squeezed his shape, and around his
neck he had a pink stock that was
waiting for a chance to choke him.
</p>

<p>
My lady friend met this gilly once
at a bean <i>soiree</i> and she was his
evening star.
</p>

<p>
They sat on the stairs together and
put a kink in the caramels.
</p>

<p>
When the gong sounded for the
ice-cream that night Lionel had dipped
her out a tubful, and he was sure she
liked him for his boyish ways.
</p>

<p>
So on this occasion it was Lionel's
play to give me the low tackle and
claim the calico.
</p>

<p>
But I'm something of a Mr. Fox
myself on rare occasions, and I
couldn't see Lionel doing a two-step
through the farm lands with my
Esmeralda&mdash;not through the opera
glasses.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane introduced me to His
Pinkness and he invited us in the
clubhouse to throttle our thirsts.
</p>

<p>
I ordered a rickey, Clara Jane called
for a lemonade, and Lionel's guess
was a pail of Vichy and milk.
</p>

<p>
When the suds rolled up I gave the
Vichy stuff the sad eye and Lionel
caught the gaze.
</p>

<p>
I could see that he wanted to back
pedal right then, but he waited until
the next round and then he waded out
among the high boys.
</p>

<p>
It was the bluff of his life.
</p>

<p>
His limit on bug bitters was imported
ginger ale with a piece of lime
in it.
</p>

<p>
When he was out roystering and
didn't care what became of him he
would tell the bartender to add a dash
of phosphates.
</p>

<p>
But now he made up his mind to
splash around in the tide waters just
because the lady was looking on.
</p>

<p>
Lionel felt that the future was at
stake and he must cut out the saw-dust
extracts and get busy with the grown-up
booze.
</p>

<p>
After the first high ball Lionel
began to chatter and mention money.
</p>

<p>
The mocking birds were singing
down on the old bayou, and he began
to give Clara Jane the loving leer.
</p>

<p>
She grew a bit uneasy and wanted
to start the paddle wheels, but I
signalled to the waiter because I wished
her to see her Society slob at his best.
</p>

<p>
At first he insisted upon dragging
out a basket of Ruinart, and he wanted
to order rubber boots so we could slosh
around in it.
</p>

<p>
But I steered him off and he went all
the way up the hill and picked out
another high fellow.
</p>

<p>
When the second high was under
cover he reached over and patted Clara
Jane on the hand.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to lead her away to Paris
and show her everything that money
could buy.
</p>

<p>
When she gave him the "Sir!" gag
he apologized and said he didn't mean
Paris, he meant the Pan-American.
</p>

<p>
Then he smiled feverishly and
opened a package of hiccoughs.
</p>

<p>
When Clara Jane and I moved out
on the links Lionel was watching the
floor and trying to pick out a spot
that didn't go 'round and 'round.
</p>

<p>
His chips were all in and he was
Simon with the Souse, for sure.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane said, "What a ridiculous
person!" but what she meant was, that
that would be about all from Lionel.
</p>

<p>
Then we chartered a couple of caddie
boys and started in to render a few
choice selections on the clubs.
</p>

<p>
My caddie boy's name was Mike,
and he looked the part.
</p>

<p>
The first crack out of the box I lost
my ball and Mike found it under his
left eye.
</p>

<p>
I gave him a quarter to square
myself and he said I could hit him on
the other eye for ten cents more.
</p>

<p>
I made the first hole in 26, and felt
that there was nothing more to live for.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane could have made it in
84, but she used up her nerve watching
a cow in the lot about two miles away.
</p>

<p>
My lady friend is a quitter when it
comes to cows.
</p>

<p>
Then we decided to stop playing and
walk around the links just so we could
say that we had seen most of the
United States of America.
</p>

<p>
Out near the Fifth hole we met
young Mil Roberts and Frank Jenvey.
</p>

<p>
They were playing a match for 60
cents a side and they were two busy
boys, all right, all right.
</p>

<p>
Mil had his sleeves rolled up to show
the mosquito bites on his muscles, and
Frank was telling himself how he
missed the last bunker.
</p>

<p>
I asked Mil what time it was and
he told me, "Three up and four to
play!"
</p>

<p>
I suppose that was Central time.
</p>

<p>
I handed Frank a few bars of polite
conversation but he gave me the
Frostburg face.
</p>

<p>
Did you ever have one of those real
players pass you out the golfish glare?
</p>

<p>
You for the snowstorm when you
get it&mdash;believe me!
</p>

<p>
Then Mil and Frank dove in the
mudcan, cooked a pill, placed the ball
on it, slapped it in the slats, gave us
the dreary day-day and were on their
way.
</p>

<p>
It must be awful to play for money.
</p>

<p>
At the Seventh hole we found Jake
Roberts ploughing the side of a hill
with his niblick.
</p>

<p>
He said he lost a ball there one day
last summer and he wanted it back
because it belonged to a set.
</p>

<p>
Jake said he went to Three in four
with that ball once, but the folks
wouldn't believe him till he showed
them the ball.
</p>

<p>
When I introduced him to Clara
Jane he invited her to join the hunting
party, and intimated that I'd enjoy
the new mown scenery further down
the line.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-109"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-109.jpg" alt="&quot;Jake invited her to join the hunting party.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;Jake invited her to join the hunting party.&quot;
</p>

<p>
I whip-sawed him with a whistling
specialty entitled, "Why Don't You
Get a Lady of Your Own?" and he
promised to be good.
</p>

<p>
After we trailed over the mountains,
through seven farms, across three
rivers, up the valley and down the
railroad, we finally reached the end of
the links and took the steamer back
to mother.
</p>

<p>
Clara Jane says golf would be a
great game if it wasn't so far from
home.
</p>

<p>
Yours till the bench breaks&mdash;believe
me!
</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
